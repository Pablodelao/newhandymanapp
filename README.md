I made a simple blackjack game. I was inspired to make a blackjack game because I play the videogame GTA V and often my friends and I play blackjack in there together. I tried as much as possible not to get help to make it.
It follows the regular rules of blackjack. 
It works by using the following API:  <a href="https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/" target="_blank">deckofcardsapi</a>


## Optimizations
In the future I would like to fix two things in terms of functionality 
1.	There is a small bug where one of the player cards won’t disappear if you click new game. This happens when the dealer draws over 3 cards, and the player drew 2 or more cards. A simple refresh fixes this and most of the time this situation won’t happen as this situation is not super frequent
2.	In blackjack the ace can be worth 1 or 11 depending on the situation. In this project for the sake of simplicity I decided to make the ace worth 11 only. But in the future, I’ll fix this.
Another improvement I would like to make is make it look better overall. I was focused on making it work but I will be working on making it look better in the future


## Lessons Learned:

Worked again with API’s I enjoyed it quite a bit. I love the kind of projects you can build with API.  I think one of my next projects will be creating my own API and making a cool project with it
